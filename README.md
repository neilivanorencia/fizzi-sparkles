Fizzi Sparkles is a conceptual, single-page website for a fictional soda brand, designed to explore the combination of 3D graphics and advanced web animations in a modern product showcase. The site builds an interactive experience by means of a sequence of scroll-based scenes that blends interface components with interactive 3D models. Built with Next.js and managed through Prismic, it demonstrates the potential of a headless CMS to drive complex, animated, and visual web experiences.

## âœ¨ Features

- **3D Hero Section**: Greets users with a dynamic intro animation featuring multiple floating 3D soda cans. As the user scrolls, the scene transitions into a new arrangement.
- **Interactive 3D Product Carousel**: Features an interactive carousel where users can cycle through different product flavors. Each selection triggers a GSAP timeline that spins the central 3D can model and smoothly transitions the interface colors and text.
- **Dynamic Text Animation** - Uses a component that animate headlines on a word-by-word or character-by-character basis, adding a polished and professional feel to content reveals.
- **Slice-Based Architecture with Prismic**: The entire page is composed of modular, reusable "Slices" managed in Prismic. This allows for content management and easy reordering of complex, animated sections without touching the code.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices to ensure usability and aesthetic appeal on all screen sizes.
